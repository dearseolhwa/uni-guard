--  UniGuard · 024 · Analytics access control (security invoker + scope)
--
--  This migration was referenced by README.md and docs/DEPLOY.md but was
--  missing from the repository. It closes the hole where the analytics views
--  from migration 008 were granted to every authenticated user and therefore
--  showed everyone (including citizens) municipality-wide aggregates.
--
--  Rules enforced here (and nowhere else):
--    · LGU / LDRRMC            -> sees analytics for all barangays
--    · Barangay Official       -> sees analytics scoped to my_barangay_id()
--    · Citizen                 -> sees NO analytics rows at all
--
--  Two mechanisms, because neither is sufficient alone:
--    1. security_invoker = true  — the view runs with the CALLER's rights, so
--       RLS on the underlying tables applies. This alone is NOT enough for
--       tables whose read policy is permissive (evacuation_centers is
--       `using (true)`), which is why:
--    2. explicit scope predicates INSIDE every view body — is_lgu() or
--       barangay_id = my_barangay_id() — so a permissive read policy can never
--       widen analytics.
--
--  The old view names keep working (the console UI selects from them), and
--  each view also gains a date-ranged function twin (p_from, p_to) that the
--  analytics screen uses for its date-range filters. The functions apply the
--  same scope internally.
--
--  Additive and idempotent: views are create-or-replace, policies/grants are
--  dropped and recreated, no data is touched.
